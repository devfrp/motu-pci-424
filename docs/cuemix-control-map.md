# CueMix control map (Phase 5.3) & the `motu424-ctl` management tool

The MOTU "management software" on Windows/macOS is **CueMix FX** — a no-latency
monitor mixer plus clock/format control that lives *on the card's DSP*, not in
the host audio stream. This note records the control set (reverse-engineered from
the shipped `CueMixFX-PCI-424.touchosc` layout, which drives MOTU's **CueMix
OSC API**) and maps it to the ALSA kcontrols the Linux driver will expose and the
`tools/motu424-ctl` userspace app will manage.

## Where this comes from

`MOTU Audio Installer 4.0.6.6814/CueMix FX TouchOSC Layouts 1.0/CueMixFX-PCI-424.touchosc`
is a zip containing `index.xml` (TouchOSC layout, names base64-encoded). Two
tab-pages — **mixes** and **inputs** — reference OSC addresses under the
`/CueMixOSCAPI` namespace. The addresses reveal the card's control model:

| OSC address (CueMix API)      | Control                          |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `/in/fvInCS+N/in/trm`         | input N **trim / gain** (rotary) + `/str` readout |
| `/in/in/pad`                  | input **pad** (−20 dB) toggle    |
| `/in/in/psi`                  | input **phase invert** toggle    |
| `/in/in/st`                   | input **stereo-pair** toggle     |
| `/in/in/mute`                 | input **mute** toggle            |
| `/bin/…/fvInCS+N/pflS`        | input **PFL / solo-listen** LED  |
| `/mix/mute`                   | per-strip **mute** in a mix      |
| `/mix/solo`                   | per-strip **solo** in a mix      |
| `/bus/fvEB+0/mix/blS`         | **bus (mix) master level** LED   |
| a fader per strip             | input→mix **send level**         |
| a rotary per strip            | input→mix **pan**                |
| `/metersToggle`, `/metersLED` | level **meters** on/off + data   |
| labels `ATTEN`/`TALK`/`LISTEN`| talkback / listen-back           |

`fvEB` = "fader-view Edit Bus" (which mix bus is shown), `fvInCS` = "fader-view
Input Channel Strip" (which input) — these are just the TouchOSC paging cursors,
**not** hardware controls. The real model is a classic **input × mix-bus matrix**:
every input has a send (level+pan+mute/solo) into each output mix bus, plus per-
input analog conditioning (trim/pad/phase/stereo) and per-bus master level+mute.

The concrete channel/bus *counts* depend on the attached AudioWire interface
(2408, 24I/O, 896HD, HD192, …) and shrink with the sample-rate family (1x/2x/4x);
that enumeration is Phase 3.5 and is discovered at runtime.

## Planned ALSA kcontrol names

The driver (Phase 5.2/5.3, needs a card) will register these; `motu424-ctl`
already knows them and pretty-prints the ones it finds. `K` = mix-bus index
(0-based, zero-padded to 2 digits).

`NN` below stands for a **channel token**. Its full form is
`<slot> <bank> <index>` — e.g. `Input B AES 01 Trim Volume`,
`Output A Analog 17 Source` — where the slot letter (`A`–`D`) is the
AudioWire jack the interface hangs off, the bank is one of `Analog`, `ADAT`,
`TDIF`, `AES`, `SPDIF`, `Main`, `Phones`, and the index is 0-based within the
bank (zero-padded to 2 digits). A bare index (`Input 03 …`) remains legal —
one anonymous bank — and is what the tools parsed before banking existed, so
both generations of the contract render fine. Channel counts, banks and slots
all come from the Phase 3.5 enumeration of whatever converters are attached
(e.g. a 24I/O contributes `Analog 00`–`23` both ways; a 1224 contributes
`Analog 00`–`07`, an `AES` I/O pair, and a `Main` output pair).

| kcontrol name (iface MIXER)     | type    | notes |
|---------------------------------|---------|-------|
| `Clock Source`                  | ENUM    | Internal, Word Clock, ADAT, SPDIF, AES/EBU, … |
| `Clock Rate`                    | INT, RO | locked rate in Hz (info/status) |
| `Sample Rate`                   | ENUM    | requested rate (44100…192000); `Clock Rate` stays the RO locked readout |
| `Meters`                        | BOOL    | enable level metering |
| `Slot S Interface`              | ENUM RO | model of the interface on AudioWire slot `S` (`A`–`D`), e.g. `24I/O`, `1224`; absent slots register nothing |
| `Input NN Trim Volume`          | INT     | analog trim, dB (per-iface range) |
| `Input NN Pad Switch`           | BOOL    | −20 dB pad |
| `Input NN Phase Switch`         | BOOL    | polarity invert |
| `Input NN Stereo Switch`        | BOOL    | pair NN/NN+1 |
| `Input NN Mute Switch`          | BOOL    | input mute |
| `Mix KK Master Volume`          | INT     | bus master fader |
| `Mix KK Mute Switch`            | BOOL    | bus mute |
| `Mix KK Input NN Volume`        | INT     | send level (matrix) |
| `Mix KK Input NN Pan`           | INT     | send pan, −100..+100 |
| `Mix KK Input NN Mute Switch`   | BOOL    | send mute |
| `Mix KK Input NN Solo Switch`   | BOOL    | send solo (PFL) |
| `Talkback Switch`               | BOOL    | talkback into the mixes (`TALK` label in the layout) |
| `Listenback Switch`             | BOOL    | listenback into the mixes (`LISTEN`) |
| `Talkback Atten Volume`         | INT     | dB the mixes duck while talk/listen is engaged (`ATTEN`) |
| `Output NN Volume`              | INT     | mono output monitor level |
| `Output NN Mute Switch`         | BOOL    | output mute |
| `Output NN Stereo Switch`       | BOOL    | pair NN/NN+1 (same convention as inputs) |
| `Output NN Source`              | ENUM    | patchbay: `Direct`, `PCM MM` (any PCM feed), or `Mix KK L` / `Mix KK R` |
| `Patchbay Switch`               | BOOL    | patchbay bypass: off = every output carries its direct PCM feed |

`Output NN` addresses **mono output channels**. Like inputs, an even channel's
`Stereo Switch` pairs it with the next index in its bank; the GUI then links
the pair's volume faders and patches the pair as a unit (a mix lands as L/R,
a PCM feed as the even-aligned consecutive pair). `Direct` is the output's own
PCM feed — the identity routing the bypass falls back to; `PCM MM`
cross-patches any PCM channel into this output, where `MM` is the output's
position in enumeration order (slots A→D, banks Analog → ADAT → TDIF → AES →
S/PDIF → Main → Phones, then index) — i.e. the fixed-frame channel the
transport carries for that output.

The output/patchbay rows and `Slot S Interface` are **not** in the TouchOSC
dump; they model what the
vendor CueMix console does when it assigns a mix bus to an output pair, plus a
Linux-side convenience: a *virtual patchbay* that can also feed a pair its
direct PCM channels, with `Patchbay Switch` as a global bypass (off = identity
routing, the safe default). They land in the same card-reported coefficient
block as the matrix sends (below).

The talkback rows map the layout's `ATTEN`/`TALK`/`LISTEN` labels; which input
feeds the talkback circuit (a CueMix FX settings dialog on Windows/macOS) is
still an open question.

These names are the contract between the kernel driver and `motu424-ctl`; keep
them in sync with `tools/motu424-ctl.c` (`KNOWN_*` tables) if either changes.

### Hardware sink (recovered)

The mixer coefficients ultimately land in a **card-reported region at device-ext
`+0x9c`** (read from the card at init, `fn 0x2c360`). The vendor driver stages
them in an inline buffer (`dev+0x110`, ~45 dwords) and flushes only the changed
range (`[dev+0x1c4]..[dev+0x1c8]`) via `WRITE_REGISTER_BUFFER_ULONG` (`fn 0x29aa0`).
So a Linux CueMix implementation writes each changed coefficient into that block
and pushes the dirty range — it does **not** need a per-control register. See
`register-map.md` (mixer coefficient region) and `fpga-upload.md` (full
destination table).

## `motu424-ctl` — the Linux CueMix

`tools/motu424-ctl` is a self-contained alsa-lib CLI (no card libraries beyond
`libasound`). It auto-locates the MOTU card (driver `motu424`) and manages the
kcontrols above — the same role CueMix FX plays on Windows/macOS.

```sh
motu424-ctl                    # status overview of the MOTU card
motu424-ctl list               # every kcontrol on the card (name/type/value)
motu424-ctl get 'Clock Source'
motu424-ctl set 'Clock Source' Internal
motu424-ctl set 'Mix 00 Input 03 Volume' 92
motu424-ctl -D hw:1 list       # target a specific card
```

Because the driver's mixer is Phase 5 (card-gated), the tool degrades cleanly:
with no MOTU card it says so; against a card that only exposes PCM (no mixer yet)
it lists what is there. It is written to light up automatically as the driver
grows its kcontrol set — no tool change needed for controls that follow the
naming table above.
